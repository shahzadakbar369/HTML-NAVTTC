	 <h2> Pakistan army </h2>
	 <p1> The army in Pakistan is highly influential. Their exact role and power has always been up for debate, with a great deal of difficult on the extent of their role in the day to day political affairs of Pakistan. However, throughout the history of Pakistan, their interference in Pakistani politics is not up for debate rather just the magnitude of it. There are various reasons the army is so powerful, but the continued animosity with neighbouring India has resulted in the need for a large and powerful military. In addition, the Cold War strengthened the military. Corruption amongst the ruling elite has only strengthened the army. Pakistan has also historically and continues to suffer from an ethnic division within the nation which has only exacerbated their problems. The army is believed to be above this ethnic division.

         The Islamic Republic of Pakistan is a relatively new nation, having only gained independence from British India in 1947. Britain ruled the Indian subcontinent for a little less than 350 years prior to Pakistan’s independence. This included time during the rule of the British Raj, as well as the British East India Company prior to that. The rule of the British raj in the Indian subcontinent ended in 1947 through independence for India and Pakistan.  Pakistan’s entire history has been marred by instability and the continued interference of the army within Pakistani politics. The core premise behind the creation of Pakistan was an independent state for the Muslims of India, who were clashing with Hindus. There were riots and clashes between both groups which led to a huge number of killings. Eventuall...
         that the rulers focused heavily on West Pakistan which allowed East Pakistan to be neglected creating greater discord. However, East Pakistan, owing to their large population demanded an equal share in the Parliament which those in the did not want to.The issue of which language the constitution should be issued in was a major reason why the creation of a constitution was delayed for so long. Jinnah prior to his death called for unity and tried to keep both entities however, with his passing the ethnic divide became greater and greater. East Pakistan wanted greater independence and autonomy. They felt they were being ruled by those in the West and that they were discriminated against for being from East Pakistan. Those in the East also spoke a different language, which was a root cause of their belief that they deserved to be separate from West Pakistan.
		 Military Pakistan’s armed forces consists of three branches, an Army, Navy and Air Force. The military service age is 16-23 years old for voluntary service, but can only deploy for combat once a male reaches 18 years of age.  Pakistan’s paramilitary forces consists of Pakistani rangers and Mehran forces, whose sole purpose is border patrol. The Frontier Corp is responsible for protecting the western borders. Maritime Security Agency is responsible for patrolling Pakistan’s territorial waters and the Airport Security protects airports in Pakistan. (“Pakistan military strength,” 2006)  Pakistan labor force for their armed forces is approximately 62,000,000. Pakistan has approximately 20 military bases throughout Pakistan. The current chief of Pakistan’s Army is General Raheel Sharif. The Pakistan armed force fighting and supporting arms include an Armored Corps, Artillery and Army Air Defense. The force also includes Infantry, Engineers and an Army Aviation Corps. Pakistan has many of the same academic schools as the United States Army to include Junior Leaders Academy (JLA), which is equivalent to Advanced Leaders Course (ALC). (“Pakistan army web portal,” n.d) Pakistan does not have much of an information Warfare capability. Computers are still almost non-existent and the government owned telecommunications barley provides security. Due to the lack of security measures, it is easy for propaganda and defamation of the government to be presented to the local populace
