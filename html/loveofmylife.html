	 <h2>The love of my life </h2>
	 <p1> Love conquers all. That’s what we hear over and over again growing up. Everyone longs for that one amazing person to waltz into our lives and steal our hearts for the rest of eternity, but is it possible that love will be strong enough to face any problem that gets in our way? T. Coraghessan Boyle once said “As strong as love might be, there is always something stronger that could come along and shatter it” (After).

T. Coraghessan Boyle was born in 1948 as Thomas John Boyle in Peekskill, New York. When Boyle went to college he never dreamed that one day he would have a major in Literature. He originally went to major in music as an aspiring saxophone player at SUNY Potsdam ("Auteur”). “That did not work out because I did not have near the…show more content…
China did not tell anyone about the baby except Jeremy. They went to two different colleges and that they would deal with the baby when it was time for China to give birth. When China’s water broke she called Jeremy and they went to a motel. Jeremy delivered the baby girl and China told him to “get rid of it” so he threw the baby in the dumpster outside (Boyle 387). They left the motel and went back to the college as if nothing ever happened. The police came the next morning and arrested both China and Jeremy. China and her parents decided to place the blame on Jeremy by allowing everyone to think that China had believed she had miscarried, and Jeremy acted alone on dumping the breathing child into the dumpster. This enormous problem eventually led to the downfall of China and Jeremy’s relationship.

Boyle gets his ideas for his stories in many different ways, some can be from him just walking down the street and an idea pops into his head, others ideas come when he is watching television or reading a book. Boyle got the idea to write “The Love of My Life” from a case he read in the newspaper (After). The case was about a murder investigation involving Amy S. Grossberg and Brian C. Peterson for the murder of their new born baby boy. Grossberg delivered the baby at a Comfort Inn in Newark, Delaware, in November 1996 (“Amy”). Grossberg was assisted by her boyfriend Brian Peterson. Peterson threw the baby in the dumpster. In March1998, Peterson
I travelled nowhere and didn't see anybody but the everyday faces in this town. I learned to love this town mostly because I was comfortable. I didn't have to worry about not knowing where I was going or not knowing people. It was simple. It was my small town. On January 1, 2013, my dad woke my two brothers and I up for our what seemed daily talks. He sat us down in our family room and said “Do y’all want to move to Mexico?” Our family room had never been so quiet not only because who the hell just asks that but we knew he was serious. Being thirteen, I jumped up and said “absolutely!”. My younger brother, who was 11, also said “why not?”. But my older brother, who was 15, turned my dad’s idea down quick mostly because he was dating “the love of his life” at the time. Through much convincing and debating, we moved to Cancun, Mexico on March 1, 2013. 
The first three weeks living there I felt like I was on a long vacation, a vacation that started lasting a little too long. By March 30, I wanted to move back. I missed my friends, my hometown, my nanna, the 20 acres I used to live on, American food and drinks, and just plain Americans! I was so tired of trying to translate Spanish to English! I was enrolled
My chubby face gazed up at my mom, who was the love of my life, and proclaimed, “This is the worst day ever because the other girls are mean and it’s raining outside.” I leaped from puddle to puddle in our pothole-infested driveway after my first day of third grade at a new school, loosely holding my mom’s hand because I trusted she would never let go.

She wrapped me in a hug before speaking in Hindi, “Meri Beti, my daughter, some people will look at you like you are the sun and some will not. But always remember that you have people who love you.”

This was something my mom would tell me many times in my life, but that I wouldn’t truly understand until I was older. 

“I just feel sad and I want to feel happy,” I complained as the gray streaks in the sky began to fade away. 

“Well, why don’t you do something that makes you feel happy,” my mom said while opening the front door. 

Feeling inspired, I rushed to my bedroom and poured my twist up crayons, bottle of silver holographic glitter, and watercolor paints onto the carpeted floor, transforming my once immaculate room into an art studio. I grabbed a stack of fresh white paper and began painting the page with blush pink hearts and cerulean blue letters spelling out “Neha’s Guide To A Better Day.” I froze, experiencing my first ever writer’s block, and contemplated what helps pull me out of a lousy mood.

Whenever the world was feeling too loud and chaotic, I would cheer myself up by visiting a place of comfort: my treehouse.
