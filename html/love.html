	 <h2> Everythimg is fair in love and war </h2>
	<p1> People say “Everything is fair in love and war”, but the truth is that the extremism of anything is bad. Be it love, or be it war.

     Everything we do should have some limits because if there are no limits, everything would be so messy or disorganized.Balance in life is extremely important, and we all actually accept it. When it comes to us, we all agree. It’s now the modern era, and we need to grow up from this mindset.

     The proverb is quite old, so we can’t say with certainty what the author actually meant or what he was trying to say, but the meaning that the world has deduced from the proverb is quite scary.

     Before, diving into the proverb more, let’s just see what it actually means and who said that.

      Everything is fair in love and war meaning
       Let’s start with the literal meaning. “Everything is fair in love and war” is used to describe a certain situation where people do not follow the usual rules of behavior and do things that are normally considered unfair.That means, people in love and war are not bound by rules of fair play, and you may not have to obey the rules of reasonable behavior.

      Eventually, that allows you to be deceitful to fulfill your objectives in the situation of love and war. The highly charged situations allow you to opt for any method of achieving your goals that is acceptable.By some means, you can understand this as everything is ok between people who love each other and at times of war.Also, you can use it synonymously with “Do whatever it takes”. This proverb is actually used to justify cheating.

     Simply, it expresses the idea of any strategy is accepted in war, and the affairs of the heart are not some competition or contest with rules, so you can do whatever you want to.

     Who said everything is fair in love and war?
         Who comes to your mind when you listen, “Everything is fair in love and war”? Nobody, because many of us, don’t even know who said that and what is the origin.

      So, here we are with the origin. It is said by “John Lyly”, as it was found in his romantic novel “Euphues, the Anatomy of Wyt, 1578”.John Lyly is an English writer, dramatist, courtier, and parliamentarian, and is known for his amazing plays.

      Although, the modern-day proverb existed in other forms before it took on the wording we now use.

       Even in John’s Euphes, it exists as:Then, after the end of the Tudor Era, an Irish translator, Thomas Shelton published an English version of Cervantes’ Don Quixote, 1620, and here you can find a similar version,Then, almost a century later, we again find another version of the proverb, that we can count as the closest in the present-day form.

       “The Artful Husband”, 1717, the comic play by the English lawyer and playwright William Taverner, has the same proverb,“All advantages are fair in Love and War.”But, all these forms don’t take away the fact that it’s said by “John Lyly” first.Finally, in 1789 we get the proverb in its modern-day form, in the novel “The Relapse, or Myrtle Bank”,We hear Everything is fair in love and war, in many forms and many quotes. Here are some of the popular quotes related to love and war.

       Love and war always go together. They are the peaks of human emotion! Evil and good, beauty and ugliness.Love and war are two contrasting forces; the former involves care and personal attachment while the latter involves brute force and destruction. They are also very similar in the sense that success in love and war can lead to the creation of happiness, relationship, devotion, liberty and freedom etc. all of which can shape a persons or societies lifestyle. However, because of such tempting and important factors, in both love and war people can become so much focused and obsessed in their cause that they forget about their moral values and may even engage in malpractice to achieve their goals. Although such means can sometimes help them achieve…show more content…
Their only justification for their action being that the benefits achieved are incommensurable. However, in doing so they forget the fact that such malpractices are all against the law which are made to secure order and stability in the society. Thus, in this context supporting John Lyly’s claim would mean supporting illegal activities, instability and anarchy all of which would make human beings no less than animals. Therefore, these criticisms provides adequate defense for my claim.

In addition to this, observing real life examples can also proves my claim. An obvious example is the violence being inflicted on women and minors in Bangladesh. Incidences such as trafficking, abuse, acid-attacks are a common scenario in this country. According to Unicef (2005) there were 266 acid attacks reported in 2005 over a one year period, affecting 322 people1. Of these, 183 were women, 76 were children under 18, and 63 were men. Although, there were other reasons, a majority of the attacks can be directly or indirectly attributed to some sick form of “one-sided love”, where the perpetrators used threat as a means of compelling the victim to accept their proposal and upon being denied wanted their demise. Such justification of love is obviously not acceptable. Similarly, in case of war I think it seems illogical destroying hundreds of innocent lives just to kill a few enemy combatants, as in the case being
