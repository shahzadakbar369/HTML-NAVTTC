	 <h1> Feedback </h1>
	 <p1> Feedback is a type of communication that we give or get. Sometimes, feedback is called "criticism," but this seriously limits its meaning. 

Feedback is a way to let people know how effective they are in what they are trying to accomplish, or how they affect you. It provides a way for people to learn how they affect the world around them, and it helps us to become more effective. If we know how other people see us, we can overcome problems in how we communicate and interact with them. Of course, there are two sides to it: giving feedback, and receiving it. 

Getting Feedback

Some people experience feedback as pure criticism and don't want to hear it. Others see it as spiritually crushing; a confirmation of their worthlessness. Still others only…show more content…
Some people are willing to accept feedback and seek it out, even if it is sometimes disturbing, because they believe they can grow from it. It comes down to whether you believe feedback will harm you or benefit you. 

This is not to say that we should always have to accept feedback or the manner in which it is sometimes given. We all have the right to refuse feedback, and we can expect feedback to be given in a respectful and supportive manner. But for every positive and open way of accepting feedback, there's an opposite; a negative and closed manner which pushes feedback away and keeps it at bay. 

The Importance of Feedback

Feedback is a must for people who want to have honest relationships. A powerful and important means for communication, giving feedback connects us, and our behavior, to the world around…show more content…
Interested: is genuinely interested in getting feedback.

Sincere: genuinely wants to make personal changes if appropriate.



Giving Feedback

The other end of feedback is giving it. Some people deliver feedback with relish; after all, it's easier to give advice than take it. Some use feedback as a weapon, or offer it as tit-for-tat. For others, feedback is a great way to be critical. 

How you deliver feedback is as important as how you accept it, because it can be experienced in a very negative way. To be effective you must be tuned in, sensitive, and honest when giving feedback. Just as there are positive and negative approaches to accepting feedback, so too are there ineffective and effective ways to give it. 

Ineffective/Negative Delivery

Attacking: hard hitting and aggressive, focusing on the weaknesses of the other person.

Indirect: feedback is vague and issues hinted at rather than addressed directly.

Insensitive: little concern for the needs of the other person. 

Disrespectful: feedback is demeaning, bordering on insulting.Positive or negative, given or received, feedback can be tricky. We shatter some popular misconceptions to guide you.

Feedback isn't always easy to give or receive. But it's vital, and timing is crucial. Here are 12 popular feedback misconceptions corrected.

Misconception 1: We don't need to worry about feedback, we conduct performance appraisals.

Truth: Annual performance appraisals aren't enough.If you've been working unsatisfactorily for 12 months, you're awfully good at doing something incorrectly. And if you've been doing something well for 12 months and no one has mentioned it, your performance appraisal might feel like too little, too late.

Performance appraisals should be summaries of everything employees and…show more content…
Keep in mind the following acronym, SARA:

* Surprise or shock. You may have no idea how to respond at first. At this time, do nothing.

* Anger. This stage also begs for inaction. Recognize your anger, do nothing, and know you'll move past it.

* Rationalization. Here come all of your excuses and defenses. Before you share them with anyone else, listen to yourself and work to separate the purely defensive from the legitimate.

* Acceptance. In this final stage, ask questions about anything that's unclear. Receiving negative feedback doesn't mean you have to accept all of it, but you do need to think it through. Then take what's helpful and put it to use.

There's no predictable timetable for moving through those stages. Different types of feedback will cause you to move through them at different speeds. Be concerned only if you seem stuck in one stage and unable to move on.

Misconception 8: I give feedback. I told Susan about my problem with Bill.

Truth: It's only feedback if you're giving it to the person involved.

John has a problem with Bill. John tells Susan about it. That's not feedback; that's a triangulated conversation. Unless Susan tells Bill a second-hand version of the complaint, Bill will still be in the dark about John's problem.

The same thing happens with praise. A supervisor often tells everyone else how great his or her team is: "My people know I'm proud of them." Do they? Have they ever heard it firsthand? Praise, like constructive
