	 <h2> HTML </h2>
	 <p1> The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.

HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as <img /> and <input /> directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as <p> surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.

HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational.

	 <h3>What is XHTML?</h3> 
     <p2>XHTML stands for Extensible Hypertext Markup Language
         XHTML is almost similar to HTML but it is stricter than HTML   
         It is swift, accurate, easily maintained, convertible, and formatted
         All major browsers support XHTML
	</p2>
	<h4>HTML vs XHTML</h4>
	<p3>
         HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language
 
         XHTML stands for Extensible Hypertext Markup Language

         It is an SGML application 

         It is an XML application 

         Tim Berners-Lee proposed it in 1987

         The World Wide Web Consortium recommended it in 2000

         HTML is not case sensitive

         XHTML is case sensitive

         HTML uses a format that is similar  to document formats

         XHTML uses markup language

         HTML can use open tags, such as<br>

         All unclosed tags must be closed in XHTML

         HTML is less expressive

         XHTML is more expressive as compared to HTML

         HTML is not mandatory for a single root element

         XHTML documents must contain at least one root element

         All content can be included in the body element

         All contents must be put in blocks

         Attribute values are not significant in HTML

         Attribute values are important in XHTML

         There is no hard rule on the structure of the elements

         The structure of the elements should be followed
